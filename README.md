## AVICII Invector with [Jitbit Macro Recorder](https://www.jitbit.com/macro-recorder/)

Song: Can't Catch Me - Hard - 100%

Keystrokes of me playing Can't Catch Me on AVICII Invector with 100% note completion on Hard, just for fun.

### Test it yourself

1. Download and open the .mcr - or copy-pase the content into Macro Recorder.
2. Start playing the song Can't Catch Me on Hard.
3. Pause the game and position your cursor over the "Restart" option.
4. Hit `Ctrl+P` and kick back.

I recoded this from Stadia, and the keystrokes doesn't appear to always line up. I'm not sure whether this is an issue with Stadia, Macro Recorder or both.
